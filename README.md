  The Tamagotchi app Report 

This how I created my app 

The Tamagotchi app is a digital rendition of the beloved virtual pet toy from the 1990s. It enables users to care for a virtual pet on their smartphones or digital devices. The app's objective is to replicate the original Tamagotchi experience, where users must tend to the needs of their virtual pets to maintain their happiness and well-being. 

Key Features and Functions: 

User Interface (UI): 

 The app's UI should be captivating and inviting, with options to personalize colors, fonts, and images to create a distinctive appearance. 

 The pet's image should change dynamically based on the user's actions. For instance, when the user taps the "feed" button, the pet's image should reflect the act of feeding. 

Welcome Screen Logic: 

 The welcome screen should showcase an image of the pet and a friendly greeting message to welcome the user. 

Incorporate a button on this screen that directs users to the main game screen when clicked. 

 Main Game Screen Logic: 

 Display the pet's image prominently on this screen to ensure the virtual pet remains the center of attention. 

 Integrate three buttons for essential actions: Feed, Clean, and Play. 

 Update the pet's visual representation to depict it eating and modify the status indicators for health, hunger, and cleanliness displayed at the bottom of the screen. 

 Cleaning Button: Initiate an animation or alter the pet's visual representation to indicate cleaning and update the cleanliness status. 

 Play Button: Activate animations or sounds to signify interaction with the pet and modify the mood or happiness levels. 

Development Process: 

 User Interface Design: 

 Start by creating the welcome screen that includes a warm message and an image of the pet. Design the main game screen featuring the pet's image and three action Buttons Utilize suitable colors, fonts, and visual elements to craft an immersive user experience. 

 Implementation of Welcome Screen: 

 Utilize Android Studio or a comparable development platform to construct the layout for the welcome screen. 

 Incorporate the pet image and welcome message, along with a button that directs users to the main game screen. 

 Implementation of Main Game Screen: 

Devise the layout for the main game screen, incorporating the pet's image and action buttons. 

 Implement the functionalities of the buttons using Java or Kotlin: 

 When the feed button is clicked, adjust the pet's image and status values correspondingly.  

The buttons for cleanliness and play are there to let users update the status of their pets according to their actions. 

Vibrant Pet Visuals: 

 Employ image assets or animations to dynamically alter the pet's appearance in response to user actions. 

 For instance, when feeding, transition to an eating animation or image; when cleaning, showcase a tidy pet visual, etc. 

Real-time Updates and Monitoring: 

 Continuously observe the pet's well-being, hunger, cleanliness, and mood levels based on user interactions. 

 Exhibit these status values on the screen for users to keep tabs on their pet's condition. 

GitHub and GitHub Actions: 

 Leverage GitHub for version control and collaborative efforts on your project. 

 Integrate GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, streamlining development. 

By following these guidelines and incorporating the mandated features and logic, you can fabricate a fully functional Tamagotchi app for Android that delivers an immersive virtual pet encounter for users.
